# Deviations

Cases where HAPI FHIR 8.12.0 and the FHIR specification disagree, or where Frevo
deliberately differs from HAPI.

This file is the **only** exception mechanism to "HAPI 8.12.0 is the reference".
A behaviour that is not recorded here and differs from HAPI is a bug, not a
decision.

## Rules

- The default resolution is **HAPI's behaviour**, because the point of the port
  is that existing deployments can switch without changing anything.
- Where matching HAPI would be actively harmful and matching the specification
  is cheap, implement the specification behaviour behind a configuration flag
  that defaults to HAPI's behaviour.
- Every entry needs a reproducing request, both responses, and a decision. An
  entry without a test referencing its ID is incomplete.
- New entries require owner review. They are a phase-boundary checkpoint.

## Entry format

```markdown
### DEV-0001 — short title

- **Area:** search | store | validator | terminology | ...
- **Scenario IDs:** search.chain.014
- **HAPI 8.12.0 behaviour:** what HAPI does, with the request and response.
- **Specification requirement:** the clause, quoted and cited.
- **Chosen behaviour:** HAPI | specification | configurable
- **Configuration flag:** `hapi.fhir.<key>` or none
- **Rationale:** why.
- **Normalizer impact:** whether the differential harness must treat this field
  as expected-to-differ, and under which rule.
- **Reviewed:** date, by whom.
```

## Entries

_None yet._ No capability is implemented, so no deviation has been observed.

Deviations are expected to concentrate in:

- search result ordering where the specification leaves order undefined;
- `_total` accuracy modes;
- validator severity levels on profile-slicing edge cases;
- `$expand` paging and `ValueSet.expansion.total` on pre-expanded value sets;
- HAPI's identifier and placeholder-reference handling in transactions.
